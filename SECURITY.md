# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is currently in development as part of a semester 3 coursework. Security updates will be applied to the latest version.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication for users and admins
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Protected admin routes and endpoints
- Token expiration and validation

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through Sequelize ORM
- XSS protection through proper data handling
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

### File Upload Security
- File type validation for image uploads
- File size limitations
- Secure file storage in designated upload directory
- Path traversal prevention

### Database Security
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Database connection security
- User password handling (Note: In production, implement proper password hashing)

## Security Considerations for Production

### Immediate Requirements
1. **Password Hashing**: Implement bcrypt or similar for password hashing
2. **HTTPS**: Use SSL/TLS certificates for encrypted communication
3. **Environment Variables**: Secure storage of JWT secrets and database credentials
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
5. **Input Validation**: Enhanced server-side validation for all inputs

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Session Management**: Implement proper session handling
2. **CSRF Protection**: Add CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
3. **Security Headers**: Implement security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
4. **Audit Logging**: Log security-relevant events
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since this is an educational project, security vulnerabilities should be reported to the development team for learning purposes.

### How to Report
1. Create an issue in the repository with the "security" label
2. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
3. Include steps to reproduce if applicable
4. Suggest potential fixes if known

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Implementation**: Depends on severity and complexity

## Security Best Practices for Development

### For Developers
1. Never commit sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc.)
2. Use environment variables for configuration
3. Validate all user inputs
4. Follow the principle of least privilege
5. Regular security code reviews

### For Deployment
1. Use HTTPS in production
2. Implement proper backup strategies
3. Monitor for security events
4. Regular security updates
5. Use secure hosting environments

## Educational Security Notes

This project serves as a learning platform for web security concepts:

### Concepts Demonstrated
- Authentication vs Authorization
- JWT token handling
- Role-based access control
- File upload security
- Database security basics
- API security principles

### Areas for Further Learning
- Advanced cryptography
- Security testing methodologies
- Penetration testing
- Security monitoring and logging
- Compliance frameworks (OWASP, etc.)

## Disclaimer

This project is developed for educational purposes. While security best practices are implemented where possible, this should not be considered production-ready without additional security hardening and professional security review.
